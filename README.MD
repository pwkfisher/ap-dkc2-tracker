#Donkey Kong Country 2 AP Tracker

##Notes

This is my first tracker, and was more of a hobby to try and learn how to do this than anything.  There will be a lot of feature ideas I have to do later, but for now this does basic level logic tracking and AP integration.  I do want to get the level shuffle working, but that will probably take some time and help - main goal is to test that all my logic is working.

##Thanks

*Seto10987 for offering help and pointing me towards the Poptracker Discord, as well as giving decent guidelines and ideas for future features.
